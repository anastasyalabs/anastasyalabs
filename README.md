## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Anastasija** — a software developer passionate about designing and engineering complete systems from the ground up.

I work across:

- 🌐 Full-stack web development  
- 🤖 Embedded systems & robotics  
- 👁️ Computer vision  
- 🧠 System architecture & low-level programming  

With a background in pharmacy, I’m deeply interested in **biology, medicine, and scientific systems**.  
Understanding complexity — whether in software or in living systems — is what drives me.

I experiment. I prototype. I rebuild.
